        How to Create Custom Elements
        One thing you might have noticed with HTML templates is that it can be tricky to insert your code in the right
        place. The earlier welcome message example was just appended to the page.

        If there was content already on the page, say, a banner image, the welcome message would appear below it.
        <bm-article-image src="../images/hina.jpg"></bm-article-image>
        As a custom element, your welcome message might look like this:

        And you can put it wherever you want on the page.

        With that in mind, let's take a look at custom elements and create our own React-like header and footer
        elements.

        Setup
        For a portfolio site, you might have some boilerplate code that looks like this:

    </bm-article>
    <script src="../script/controlPixelRatio.js"></script>
    <script src="../script/articleTemplate.js"></script>
    <script src="../script/articleImage.js"></script>

</body>
