    I've thought a lot before I started this article,
    but it seems that I've lost most of those thought,
    so it might not a long article.🥲

    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="display: flex;">
      Just as always,
      I still believe that the greatest stroke of luck in my life has been
      encountering the people I've met over the past life.
      <br>
      Thanks to them, I can survive the entire year and just be here writing down the article,
      like bzpovo, wzdszlzczmzmn, 『夏』, 「11」and so on.
      And of course I can't forget to mention my girlfriend whom I love more and more and more each day.
      <br>
      And also, I cherish「TIC科创」and『荆棘鸟』just as much, as still.

    this year is a bad year.
    <br>
    I even totally forget what had happened in the first half.
    It's a period of darkness and sadness.
    <br>
    But there were many happy things too. We've organized『青空祭』successfully!
    It must be one of the happiest days in my life---it felt like a dream, simply the best.
    <br>
    And I just simply enjoyed the life with my girlfriend.

    <br>
    <br>
    Most days in the latter half feel almost identical to the last.
    <br>
    <div style="display: flex;">
      the trip to「太仓」just shattered my final illusion about my college.
      <br>
      Now, I just think it's a completely wrong decision to come here, a waste of my time to be here.
      I've discussed the drawbacks of the college too much with my friends extensively.
      So no time will be wasted here more, I'll just ignore it and do not try to change anything.
      <br>
      But luckily, I've resigned from the position of monitor.
      Thanks that, I can get rid of most the troubles of teh college
      and now see them as jokes---OH, SORRY, AS MULTIPLE JOKES.
      They are too funny.

    And then I've to thanks to @wuwei, @燕十三 and teacher『印』&『谢』.
    <br>
    They are so kind and give me a lot of chance to be better, cheer me up and say nothing bad.
    But I feel really sorry for them because I just achieve nothing, and disappointed them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Previously, I believed it was a lack of opportunities that hindered my improvement.
    However, I've come to realize that
    it's my own inadequacy preventing me from seizing or even recognizing any chance,
    allowing them to slip away.
    <br>
    <br>
    So the only target for me now, is be better.
    I will not image some one 'save' me without taking nothing in the future.

    I believe Open source can make me better and I like to help others as well.

    So, my next year target is get the apache email,
    which is the prove of
    <strong>My strength and growth</strong>.
    Now it's the end. I'll use my favorite picture I've see in this year as the end.

    Although I mentioned using this picture as the end of my article,
    but actually, it was the firstl thing I included.🤣
